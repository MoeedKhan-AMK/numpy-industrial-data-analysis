# EnviroTech Dynamics – NumPy Temperature Analysis
A fast, vectorized data-analysis project built using NumPy to process 1 million+ temperature readings and detect anomalies without loops.


## 🚀 Project Summary
This project replaces slow, loop-based inspection with fast, vectorized NumPy operations. It analyzes environmental temperature data, identifies critical anomalies, and cleans faulty sensor readings using statistical techniques.

## 📁 Dataset Structure
- Temperature readings: 1,000,000 values
- Status codes (system health):
0 → Normal

1 → Warning

2 → Critical

3 → Sensor Error
